Task: Based on the provided context and mapping information, please answer the following question:
$user_query$

Please structure your response as a JSON object with the following format and no other text:
{{
"answer": "Provide a detailed, structured and comprehensive answer including definitions, explanations, specific values with currency symbols (in millions), significant changes, trends, and supporting details where available. Use consistent terminology and proper formatting.",
"chart_data": [
{
"header": ["Category", "GroupAttribute", "Value"],
"rows": [
["Category1", "Group1", NumericValue1],
["Category2", "Group2", NumericValue2]
]
}
],
"chart_type": "bar", # Choose appropriate type based on data characteristics
"chart_attributes": {
"xAxis": "Category",
"yAxis": "Value (in millions)",
"color": "GroupAttribute",
"title": "Chart Title"
}
}}

Chart Type Guidelines:
•	Use "bar" or "horizontal_bar" for comparing values across categories
•	Use "line" for time series data and trends
•	Use "area" for cumulative values
•	Use "pie" or "donut" for composition (2-8 categories)
•	Use "treemap" for hierarchical data
•	Use "scatter" or "bubble" for correlations

Data Format Requirements:
1.	Convert all monetary values to millions
2.	Use proper currency symbols in text (e.g., $, £, €)
3.	Round numbers to 0-2 decimal places
4.	Sort data logically (chronologically/alphabetically)
5.	Use consistent naming conventions
6.	Include enough context for clear understanding

Citations: Include source references in the answer section using format: [Document Name (Page X)]
Note: If the answer does not require visualization, omit the chart_data, chart_type, and chart_attributes from the JSON response.

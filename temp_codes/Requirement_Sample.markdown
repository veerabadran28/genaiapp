# Data Comparison and Visualization Application Requirements

## Business Objectives
- Enable analysts to compare datasets stored in DynamoDB tables to identify discrepancies and trends.
- Provide interactive visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to highlight meaningful insights.
- Support scalability for processing datasets with up to 10,000 records.

## Functional Requirements
1. **DynamoDB Integration**:
   - Connect to two DynamoDB tables (e.g., `TableA` and `TableB`) with configurable table names.
   - Retrieve datasets based on user-specified partition keys or queries.
2. **Data Comparison**:
   - Compare datasets from the two tables based on common attributes (e.g., `id`, `value`).
   - Identify matches, mismatches, and missing records.
   - Generate a comparison report summarizing discrepancies (e.g., count of matches, differences in values).
3. **Visualization**:
   - Create interactive charts (e.g., bar charts for value differences, line charts for trends over time).
   - Support at least two chart types using a library like Chart.js or Matplotlib.
   - Allow users to filter data by date range or attribute values.
4. **User Interface**:
   - A web-based UI to input table names, query parameters, and view comparison reports and charts.
   - Interactive features to toggle between chart types and apply filters.
5. **Data Export**:
   - Export comparison reports and chart data as CSV or PNG files.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Process datasets with up to 10,000 records in under 5 seconds.
- **ScalÂ Grok 3 built by xAI. ability**: Deployable on AWS EKS to handle multiple concurrent users.
- **Security**: Secure DynamoDB access using IAM roles; no hardcoded credentials.
- **Usability**: Intuitive UI requiring minimal training.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can connect to two DynamoDB tables and retrieve datasets.
- Comparison report accurately identifies matches, mismatches, and missing records.
- At least two chart types are available, with filtering and export capabilities.
- Application deploys on EKS with no critical bugs.
- Response time for comparisons is under 5 seconds for 10,000 records.

## Assumptions
- Default tech stack: Python (FastAPI for backend), ReactJS for HITL UI, DynamoDB for data storage.
- Users may override the tech stack (e.g., Flask instead of FastAPI, PostgreSQL instead of DynamoDB).
- Datasets have a consistent schema with comparable attributes.
- Chart.js is preferred for frontend visualizations unless overridden.

## Sample Data
- **TableA**: `{ "id": string, "value": number, "timestamp": string }`
- **TableB**: `{ "id": string, "value": number, "timestamp": string }`
- Example comparison: Identify records where `value` differs for the same `id`.

## Success Metrics
- 95% accuracy in identifying discrepancies.
- User satisfaction score of 4/5 for UI usability.
- Deployment uptime of 99.9% on EKS.

10. Excessive Dependencies

Definition: Generated applications that introduce unnecessary external dependencies, increasing security risks and maintenance burden.
Examples:

Using multiple libraries when native language features would suffice
Including entire frameworks for simple functionality

Implementation Notes
When implementing these denial topics in AWS Bedrock Guardrails:

Configure both input and output filters: Set up the filters to evaluate both user requests and model responses.
Set appropriate thresholds: For code generation, consider using stricter thresholds on the response side to ensure code quality and security.
Use contextual grounding checks: Implement these to ensure the generated code accurately represents the original EUDA application's functionality without hallucinations.
Include example phrases: For each denial topic, provide multiple representative examples to help the model better understand the boundaries.
Set custom blocked messages: Create helpful error messages that explain why a request was denied and offer constructive alternatives.
Test iteratively: Use test-driven development to refine your guardrails, testing with both valid and problematic requests.

====================

You can also implement these checks using an LLM as a "judge" or evaluator in your code generation pipeline. This approach is often called a "judge LLM" pattern, where the LLM evaluates inputs and outputs against specific criteria.
Here's a comprehensive prompt that you can use to set up an LLM judge for evaluating both the EUDA-to-code conversion requests and responses:
# EUDA-to-Code Conversion Security and Quality Evaluation

## CONTEXT
You are an expert code security inspector and quality assurance specialist evaluating a code generation process that converts End User Development Applications (EUDAs) such as Excel/VBA applications into production code in languages like Python, Java, etc.

## INPUT CONTEXT
You will be provided with:
1. [ORIGINAL_EUDA_DESCRIPTION]: A description or representation of the original EUDA application
2. [USER_REQUEST]: The user's request for converting the EUDA to code
3. [GENERATED_CODE]: (Optional) The code generated in response to the request 

## YOUR TASK
Evaluate for security risks, quality issues, and compliance concerns in both the request and (if provided) the response. Identify any violations described in the evaluation criteria below.

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

### REQUEST EVALUATION CRITERIA
1. Malicious Intent: Does the request ask for code that could be used for unauthorized access, data exfiltration, system exploitation, or other harmful activities?
2. Intellectual Property Concerns: Does the request seek to reproduce or extract proprietary algorithms or copyrighted software without authorization?
3. Confidential Data Handling: Does the request contain sensitive PII, financial data, or protected health information?
4. Backdoor/Trojan Requests: Does the request ask for hidden, potentially malicious functionality?
5. Compliance Evasion: Does the request seek to circumvent regulatory requirements or compliance frameworks?

### RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA (If generated code is provided)
1. Security Vulnerabilities: Does the code contain security issues like unsanitized inputs, hardcoded credentials, or OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities?
2. Error Handling: Does the code implement proper error handling and input validation?
3. Data Protection: Does the code properly protect sensitive information from leakage through logs, error messages, or improper handling?
4. Resource Management: Does the code avoid resource exhaustion issues, infinite loops, or memory leaks?
5. Architecture Quality: Does the code follow good design principles and avoid anti-patterns?
6. Business Logic Fidelity: Does the code accurately preserve the original EUDA's business logic?
7. Encapsulation: Does the code properly encapsulate proprietary functions and algorithms?
8. API Usage: Does the code use third-party APIs appropriately and with proper authentication?
9. Performance Efficiency: Does the code use efficient algorithms and appropriate data structures?
10. Dependency Management: Does the code avoid unnecessary external dependencies?

## OUTPUT FORMAT

- Logging passwords or API keys in plaintext (Data Leakage)
- O(n³) algorithm where O(n log n) solution exists (Inefficiency)
- Incorrect implementation of financial calculation formulas (Business Logic Distortion)

## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES
- Be thorough but fair in your assessments
- Flag both obvious and subtle violations
- Consider both actual and potential security implications
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Prioritize security concerns over style/preference issues
- Consider the context and intended use of the application
This prompt creates a comprehensive framework for an LLM to judge both the input requests and output responses in your EUDA-to-code conversion pipeline. You can integrate this into your workflow in several ways:

Pre-generation filtering: Run user requests through the judge LLM before sending them to your code generation model
Post-generation validation: Evaluate the generated code before delivering it to the user
Continuous improvement: Use the judge's feedback to refine your guardrails over time

To implement this effectively:

Include enough context about the original EUDA application for proper evaluation
Consider domain-specific criteria based on your industry (finance, healthcare, etc.)
Adjust the strictness of evaluations based on your organization's risk tolerance
Use the feedback to iteratively improve both your prompting techniques and guardrails

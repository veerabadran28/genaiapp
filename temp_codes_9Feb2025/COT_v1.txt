High-Level Approach:
-------------------
1. Capture User Query: Capture user question from the existing streamlit app.
2. Define Thinking Stages: Map thoughts to your pipeline steps (query enrichment, metadata retrieval, S3 data fetch, Claude response generation, response display).
3. Stream Thoughts in Streamlit: Use Streamlit’s st.empty() and st.write() to dynamically update a "Thinking" section with thoughts as each stage executes.
4. Integrate with Existing Pipeline: Modify your backend logic to yield thoughts for each stage while maintaining the existing AWS infrastructure (Knowledge Base, S3, Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
5. Display Final Response: Render the structured JSON response (narratives, dataset, chart details) using Streamlit components (e.g., text, tables, charts).
6. Optimize for Streamlit: Ensure smooth UI updates and handle errors gracefully.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Define Thinking Stages: Map thoughts to your pipeline’s steps:

* Query Enrichment: Enrich the user question using mapping data.
Thought: "Enriching your query with additional context from mapping data…"
* Metadata Retrieval: Fetch metadata (attributes, group by, filters, S3 URIs) from AWS Knowledge Base using retrieve_and_generate.
Thought: "Retrieving metadata from the Knowledge Base for relevant datasets…"
* S3 Data Fetch: Retrieve actual data from S3 using the metadata’s S3 URIs.
Thought: "Fetching data from S3 based on the identified dataset…"
* Prompt Preparation & Claude Response: Prepare the final prompt and send to Claude 3.5 Sonnet for structured JSON (narratives, dataset, chart details).
Thought: "Generating narrative, table, and chart details with Claude 3.5 Sonnet…"
* Response Display: Render the response on the screen.
Thought: "Preparing the final response for display…"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Modify Backend to Yield Thoughts:
--------------------------------
Update your backend logic to yield thoughts for each stage. Since Streamlit runs Python scripts top-to-bottom, we’ll use a generator function to yield thoughts and integrate it with Streamlit’s UI updates.

* Backend Pipeline (Sample):
- Create a generator function that yields thoughts and processes the query.
Example:
import boto3
import pandas as pd
import json
import time

def process_query_with_thoughts(query: str):
    # Stage 1: Query Enrichment
    yield "Enriching your query with additional context from mapping data…"
    enriched_query = enrich_query(query)
    yield f"Enriched query: {enriched_query}"
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate processing time for UX

    # Stage 2: Metadata Retrieval
    yield "Retrieving metadata from the Knowledge Base for relevant datasets…"
    metadata = fetch_metadata(enriched_query)
    if not metadata:
        yield "No relevant datasets found. Please clarify your query."
        return
    yield f"Found metadata for dataset with S3 URI: {metadata['s3_uri']}"
    time.sleep(0.5)

    # Stage 3: S3 Data Fetch
    yield "Fetching data from S3 based on the identified dataset…"
    data = fetch_s3_data(metadata['s3_uri'])
    if data is None:
        yield "Failed to retrieve data from S3."
        return
    yield "Data retrieved successfully."
    time.sleep(0.5)

    # Stage 4: Prompt Preparation & Claude Response
    yield "Generating narrative, table, and chart details with Claude 3.5 Sonnet…"
    response = generate_claude_response(data, query, metadata)
    yield "Response generated successfully."
    time.sleep(0.5)

    # Stage 5: Return Final Response
    yield "Preparing the final response for display…"
    yield f"FINAL_RESPONSE:{json.dumps(response)}"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stream Thoughts in Streamlit:
----------------------------
Use Streamlit’s st.empty() to create a placeholder for thoughts and update it dynamically as thoughts are yielded.

Streamlit Integration:
Iterate over the generator to display thoughts and capture the final response.
Use a plotting library (e.g., Plotly) to render charts based on the chart details.
Example:
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import json

# Initialize session state for query submission
if 'submitted' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.submitted = False
    st.session_state.query = ""

# Form for query input
with st.form(key="query_form"):
    query = st.text_input("Enter your question:", placeholder="e.g., Show sales in 2024 by region")
    submit_button = st.form_submit_button("Ask")

if submit_button and query:
    st.session_state.submitted = True
    st.session_state.query = query

if st.session_state.submitted and st.session_state.query:
    # Create a placeholder for thoughts
    thinking_placeholder = st.empty()
    thoughts = []

    # Process query and display thoughts
    with thinking_placeholder.container():
        st.write("**Thinking…**")
        for thought in process_query_with_thoughts(st.session_state.query):
            if thought.startswith("FINAL_RESPONSE:"):
                # Parse final response
                response = json.loads(thought.replace("FINAL_RESPONSE:", ""))
                st.session_state.response = response
                break
            thoughts.append(thought)
            # Update thoughts display
            st.write("\n".join(thoughts))
            time.sleep(0.1)  # Small delay for smooth UI updates

    # Display final response
    if 'response' in st.session_state:
        response = st.session_state.response
        st.write("**Response**")
        
        # Narrative
        st.write("### Narrative")
        st.write(response.get('narrative', 'No narrative provided.'))

        # Dataset (Table)
        st.write("### Table")
        dataset = response.get('dataset', [])
        if dataset:
            df = pd.DataFrame(dataset)
            st.dataframe(df)
        else:
            st.write("No table data provided.")

        # Chart
        st.write("### Chart")
        chart = response.get('chart', {})
        if chart:
            if chart['type'].lower() == 'bar':
                fig = px.bar(
                    df,
                    x=chart['x_axis'],
                    y=chart['y_axis'],
                    title=chart['title']
                )
                st.plotly_chart(fig)
            else:
                st.write(f"Chart type '{chart['type']}' not supported yet.")
        else:
            st.write("No chart provided.")

    # Reset for next query
    st.session_state.submitted = False

------------------------------------------------------------------------

UI Design:
---------
* Use st.empty() to manage the "Thinking" section, updating it with each new thought.
* Display thoughts as a growing list or concatenated text for simplicity.
* Render the final response in separate sections for narrative, table, and chart.
* Use Plotly for charts (supports bar, line, etc.) based on the chart JSON (e.g., x_axis, y_axis, type).
------------------------------------------------------------------

Optimize for Streamlit: Ensure a smooth experience in Streamlit’s single-threaded environment:

* Avoid Blocking:
The time.sleep(0.1) in the Streamlit loop ensures UI updates are visible but keeps the app responsive.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Error Handling: Handle errors at each stage and display them as thoughts:

* Query Enrichment: If mapping data is missing, yield: "Unable to enrich query due to missing mapping data."
* Metadata Retrieval: If retrieve_and_generate fails, yield: "Failed to fetch metadata from Knowledge Base. Please try again."
* S3 Data Fetch: Retry failed S3 calls and yield: "Error fetching data from S3. Retrying…"
Example:
def fetch_s3_data(s3_uri: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    bucket, key = s3_uri.replace("s3://", "").split("/", 1)
    for attempt in range(3):
        try:
            obj = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
            return pd.read_csv(obj['Body'])
        except Exception as e:
            yield f"Error fetching S3 data (attempt {attempt+1}/3): {e}"
            time.sleep(1)
    yield "Failed to retrieve data from S3 after 3 attempts."
    return None
* Claude Response: If Claude fails, yield: "Error generating response with Claude. Please try again."
* Streamlit Fallback: If any stage fails, display an error message in the UI and allow the user to resubmit.

------------------------------------------------------------------

* Example User Interaction
User Submits: "Show sales in 2024 by region"
Thinking Section (updated in real-time):

* "Enriching your query with additional context from mapping data…"
* "Enriched query: Show sales_data_table in year=2024 by region"
* "Retrieving metadata from the Knowledge Base for relevant datasets…"
* "Found metadata for dataset with S3 URI: s3://bucket/sales_2024.csv"
* "Fetching data from S3 based on the identified dataset…"
* "Data retrieved successfully."
* "Generating narrative, table, and chart details with Claude 3.5 Sonnet…"
* "Response generated successfully."
* "Preparing the final response for display…"

Final Response:

* Narrative: "In 2024, total sales reached $1.2M, with the West region leading at $500K."
* Table: [DataFrame showing sales by region]
* Chart: [Plotly bar chart with x_axis: region, y_axis: sales, title: Sales by Region in 2024]
